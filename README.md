Some very basic examples I run on S7-314. I only use this repo as a personal backup, but I made it public.

- [pass-OB1](pass-OB1.stl): press 3 buttons in correct order (0-2-1) and green led turns on.
- [sliding-light-OB35](sliding-light-OB35.stl): sliding output (light if powered) on one output bank
