Some very basic examples I run on S7-314C-2 DP. I only use this repo as a personal backup, but I made it public.

- [pass](pass-OB1.stl): press 3 buttons in correct order (0-2-1) and green led turns on.
- [sliding light](sliding-light-OB35.stl): sliding output (light if powered) on one output bank
- [double sliding light with onoff](double-sliding-light-with-onoff-ob35.stl): sliding output on two digial output banks controlled with two digital inputs
